# libros

libros is a work done for a course on digital signal processing. It is mostly an exploratory work with the driving idea being the possibility of treating sequence of words as usual signals where spectral analysis can be done.

The project attempts to learn the writing styles of (few) famous novelists by using the flow of words in their works.
