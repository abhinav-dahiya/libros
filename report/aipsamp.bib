abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large num- ber of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alterna- tive to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of “Canada” and “Air” cannot be easily combined to obtain “Air Canada”. Motivated by this example,we present a simplemethod for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

abstract = {We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

@article{Salvador2004,
abstract = {The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm is able to find the optimal alignment between two time series. It is often used to determine time series similarity, classification, and to find corresponding regions between two time series. DTW has a quadratic time and space complexity that limits its use to only small time series data sets. In this paper we introduce FastDTW, an approximation of DTW that has a linear time and space complexity. FastDTW uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarse resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically. We also analyze the accuracy of FastDTW compared to two other existing approximate DTW algorithms: Sakoe-Chuba Bands and Data Abstraction. Our results show a large improvement in accuracy over the existing methods.},
